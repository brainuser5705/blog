The question of the universe is not *what is life*, it's **how tf do I manage my projects?**?  

---

Every time I start a project, I always get stuck in that limbo phase where I don't know how to go about making it. I mean I know what I want and what I need to do, but there's always that second guessing - *am I doing this right? is there a better way of doing something?*

I am jealous of those that have some self system for planning when it comes to anything: school, projects, work, self-care... And then there's me. Someone who kind of just does whatever feels right at the moment. That's not good. 

Now I could go on a full-blown research project to try to find the *oPtIMal* way of planning projects. But that's kind of the opposite of what I want. I want to get rid of that phase of not doing. I want to just pick something, stick with it, and get some stuff working!
