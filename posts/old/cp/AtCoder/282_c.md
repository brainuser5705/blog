# [AtCoder 282 - C (String Delimiter)](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc282/tasks/abc282_c)

## My Solution 
```python
N = int(input())
S = list(input()) # need to convert to list bc string does not support item assignment

enclosed = False
for i in range(N):
    if S[i] == '"':
        enclosed = not enclosed
    elif not enclosed and S[i] == ',':
        S[i] = '.'

print(''.join(S))
```

## Main Idea
All the variables (`K`, `i`) are actually not necessary to formulate into the algorithm. It is essentially a formal way of saying that every other quote (or every odd quote) is paired to its rightmost quote (or its even quote), as shown in the table.

| i | 2i - 1 | 2i |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | 5 | 6 |

That means the left quote of the pair represents the start of the enclosing, and the right quote of the pair represents the end of the enclosing. Using this, we could traverse through the string with a "trigger" boolean that would be set each time we encountered a `"`. If we encounter a `,` , we can check the trigger to determine if we need to change it.
