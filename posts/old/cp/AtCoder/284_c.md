## Important Information

A single point counts as a simple graph, and thus counts as a connected subgraph. [(source)](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/446265/is-a-graph-with-only-one-node-a-connected-graph)

## My Failed and Passed Solution

### First attempt:
```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())

visited = set()

count = 0

for _ in range(M):

    u1, u2 = map(int, input().split())

    if u1 not in visited and u2 not in visited:

        count += 1

    visited.add(u1)

    visited.add(u2)

print(count + N - len(visited)) # count + any single vertices
```

*Main idea:* Visit vertices. If both vertices were not visited, then a new connected subgraph was found (another way of putting it - if either vertices were visited, then there is no separate subgraph). Add the vertices to the `visited` set. Repeat for all the input edges. Return the count and any unvisited single vertices (`N - len(visited)`).

This case, however, would not work if input was:
```
4 3
1 2 
3 4 -> error starts here
2 4
```
since the algorithm would count 2 but will need to go back down to 1.

### Second attempt:
```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())

# create an adjacency list
arr = [[0 for _ in range(1)] for _ in range(N)]
for _ in range(M):
    u1, u2 = map(int, input().split())
    arr[u1-1] += [u2]
    arr[u2-1] += [u1]

visited = set()
count = 0
# go through vertices in order
for i in range(N):

	# assume the vertex is not connected
    count += 1
    visited.add(i+1)
    connected = False

	# go through all its connections 
	# to check if any of them is already connected
    for j in range(1, len(arr[i])):
        itm = arr[i][j]
        # set boolean if item is connected
        if itm in visited:
            connected = True
            continue
        # add new item to visited set
        visited.add(itm)

	# if vertex has a connection, 
	# then subtract from count
    if connected:
        count -= 1

print(count)
```

This takes a more "sequential" approach by making an *adjacency matrix*. 
> The matrix initialization is convoluted with the `0` placeholder instead of an empty list. It also results in starting `j` with index 1 to skip the initial `0`.

This algorithm fails for input:
```
4 3
1 4
4 3
3 2
```
also with the same case that the count adds up to 2 but will need to go back to 1.

## Final Solution

So it looks like the issue is unforeseen connections as the loop is going through the edges or vertices in order. It would add what seems like a separated subgraph initially since none of its vertices were visited, but it would turn out that the subgraph was connected from the next edge/vertex in order.

Scrapping the idea of visiting in order, the passed solution takes a **DFS** approach where nodes were visited by order of connection.

```python
N, M = map(int, input().split())
arr = [[0 for _ in range(1)] for _ in range(N)]
for _ in range(M):
    u1, u2 = map(int, input().split())
    arr[u1-1] += [u2]
    arr[u2-1] += [u1]


visited = set()

# recursive DFS function that adds the vertices to visited set
def visit(n):
    count = 0
    # skips the vertex is already visited
    if n not in visited:
	    # otherwise add to count 
	    # and visit its connections
        count = 1
        visited.add(n)
        for j in range(1, len(arr[n-1])):
            itm = arr[n-1][j]
            # returned count is ignored, 
            # since we are just adding connections to visited
            visit(itm)
    return count

# runner loop - it goes through the vertex in order
n = 1
connections = 0
while len(visited) != N:
    connections += visit(n)
    n += 1

print(connections)
```

*Main idea*: Create an adjacency matrix. Visit vertex (via `while` loop) and recursively visit its connections. Accumulate the count in the loop.

The reason why the returned `count` of the recursive call to `visit()` in itself is because the `count` is accumulated in the for loop.
