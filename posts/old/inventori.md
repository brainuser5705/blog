# Building Inventori

## 3/10/23
- Bought Raspberry Pi Zero WH from The Pi Hut for 14 pounds
    - This was probably the best deal considering the shortage of Raspberry microcmputers now. I figure that once they do have stock at the end of 2023, this project wouldn't be relevant anymore. If I split the project costs with Zoe, the price shouldn't be too bad - it's not going to be as cheap as $5 boards, but it definitely beats the exorbant prices of $100-$200 you see on some sites.
    - This was the site that I used to find the vendors that were in stock: https://rpilocator.com/?cat=PIZERO
- Now I need to buy the micro HDMI to HDMI adaptor and a micro SD card. Might end up buying a kit on Amazon.
