# My Solution

```python
# Gets all possible combinations from the given number of participants
def get_all_pairs(num):
    pairs = []
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        for j in range(i+1, num+1):
            pairs.append([i,j])
 
    return pairs
 
def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    S = [input() for _ in range(N)]
 
    # Goes through all the possible pairs
    # Checks if the pairs' strings can collectively answer all the questions
    # Triggers a boolean which determines if the count is incremented
    count = 0
    pairs = get_all_pairs(N)
    for pair in pairs:
        all_correct = True
        for i in range(M):
            if not(S[pair[0]-1][i] == 'o' or S[pair[1]-1][i] == 'o'):
                all_correct = False
                break
        if all_correct:
            count += 1
    
    # After all the possible pairs are evaluated, the count is printed
    print(count)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

# Review

- Comparing to the [official solution](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc282/editorial/5425) in the editorial, my solution is pretty much similar except I could add one optimization by creating the pairs just in time for comparison instead of storing it in an auxiliary list.

- Other solutions have an additional "inner" counter instead of the `all_correct` boolean. If the inner counter is equal to `M` by the end of the for loop, then the `count` is incremented.

- **`for - else`** [example](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc282/submissions/37734916)
    - It goes through the for loop as normal, but has an `else` condition that only executes if the for loop *does not* end prematurely.
    - If the for loop is stopped by a `break`, then the `else` condition will not run

N, M = map(int,input().split())

P = [input() for _ in range(N)]

count = 0
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(i+1, N):

        for m in range(M):
            if not (P[i][m] == 'o' or P[j][m] == 'o'):
                break
        else:
            count += 1

print(count)
```
