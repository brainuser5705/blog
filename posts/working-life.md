# Working Life

I guess it's my turn to do a day in the life of a software engineer ~~vlog~~ blog. This post is documenting all the different routines I will be trying until I find my best fit for an 8 hour workday.

## Approach 1 (Work 8-5)

**Routine**
- Wake up around 6-7am
- Eat breakfast, bike over to the library
- Work around 7:30-8am
- Lunch around 11-12pm (about an hour)
- Work
- *Done* around 4-5pm

**Pros**
- Start work fresh since it's the first thing I do
- Structured, know what to do next

**Cons**
- No energy at the end of work so I'm not doing much besides watching videos
- Productivity declines over the course of the day
- Productivity starts to wane around 11-12pm

## Approach 2 (Ease in)

**Lessons from Approach 1**
- I am most productive in the morning (don't have a headache when I look at code)
- I need to set some time blocks for different tasks (coding, checking messages, etc.)
- I need more than an hour to destress after lunch otherwise I won't be productive
- I want to do other things than work

**Routine**
- Wake up around 6am
- Go out for a run
- Eat breakfast, 1-2 hours of competitive programming
- Bike over to the library (ease in)
- Work around 9-9:30am
- Lunch around 1-2pm (about two hour)
- Work around 3-5pm
- *Done* around 6-7pm
- Cook and eat dinner
- Continue personal goals
- Sleep around 9-10pm

**Work Routine** (new addition)
- Work on current issue (code, read on docs, ask questions) for ~3 hours
    - Make a plan first before coding so it goes smoother
- *(15 min break)*
- Check email for any updated PRs and fix them
- Check other Slack messages
- *(Lunch Break)*
- Continue working on issue, etc. for ~3 hours
- *(15 min break)*
- Check other Slack messages
- Codebase exploration

Note: Set a timer
