# Jumping into the Rabbit Hole That Is Linux

This blog is a collection of stories, updates, and in the worst case, rants about my Linux experiment.

## I Purchased Thinkpad Laptop
> Date created: April 21, 2023

Before starting this experiement, my one and only machine was a HP Spectre x360. I don't know the specific model by heart, but it's safe to say that it was definitely built for Windows. This Linux experiment isn't my first; around two summers ago I decided to try Linux out and after some major close-calls (i.e. breaking everything), I had dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows 10 on the Spectre. 

But unfortunately, there were a lot of issues. A lot of the hardware didn't have drivers available on Ubuntu. Camera, mic, and speakers were a no go. Coupled that with my lack of Linux knowledge, I had no idea what I was doing and I ended up switching back to Windows-only. Then a couple months later, I attempted to install Linux again on the Spectre. No luck either.

**But now, I have a THINKPAD.** I was in the market for a new laptop mainly because I was getting bored of the Windows and Spectre (ah, first-world problems). I wanted to give Linux another shot, so given my past experience, I was in the market for a Linux laptop. I initially had my wallet set on System76 but got sucked into the rabbit hole of consumer electronics and Reddit, so I spent a good two days just browsing the internet for what laptop I should get. It was either a $1000+ brand new laptop with the latest specs or a cheap (but still popping) Thinkpad. The key questions were "what will I do with the laptop", "can I upgrade it", and "is it worth the money".

Long story short and skipping over a lot of details, I won a bid on Ebay and paid ~$200 for Thinkpad T480 with a 8th generation i7-8650U Intel Core CPU, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD. Despite the bad specs, it's a pretty darn good price and I can always upgrade the laptop if I need to.
