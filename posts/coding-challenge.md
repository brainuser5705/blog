# Coding Challenges

One thing I really want to change is my production rate, i.e. the rate at which I produce projects. I have a good amount of project ideas, but every little spark of motivation I get to start any one of these projects quickly dies. There's a lot of things to blame, but I would say mainly laziness, documentation, and semi-perfectionism (I don't really like to "hack" things). So I'm giving myself a challenge to finish a project every two weeks. It doesn't matter how good it is, just as long as I work on it everyday and having a finish working product.
