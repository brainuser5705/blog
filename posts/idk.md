## The problem

What's the word that means a character trait that someone has that is good but also will bring death upon them?

Everyone has a different approach to coding. Some people like doing tutorials and applying their newfound skills to their own creation. Some people like to do courses. Some people like to look at examples.

I wouldn't say I have a clear-cut method that I follow, but I typically start off with a project in mind and something that I need to learn for the project. I would go to the official documentation and see if they have guides/tutorials. From there, I will read through docs after docs until I feel ready and then I will code. It's not restrictive where I can't code at all while I'm learning, in fact I would say I switch between learning and coding very often.

This method has worked in some ways, but I don't like it. I hate reading documentation but it feels like the only way to do things right. I am bounded to the docs not only because I can learn from it, but it teaches me the "official", the "right" way to do things otherwise it's wrong.

## the realization

I was watching a Clairo interview ( . __ . )....and it got me thinking about musicians (and artists in general) on how they start off on a new project. I'm pretty sure they don't crack out musical pieces and theory books to write music or paint. They just play around. They just make it. They have a vision and through trial and error, they make it work. 

So is this the < insert-forgotten-word > of the programmer (or just me specifically)? Is my inability to break away from the docs the only way for me to succeed? What would be my creative input? Will I ever get to play around with something before consulting the docs? What makes programming fun?
