# The Neurotic Programmer

## Introduction

I would say I'm a pretty neurotic person. I worry a lot, overthink things, and it affects my self-empathy, self-esteem, and self-confidence. I get especially neurotic when it comes to things that I tend to place my a lot of self-worth on like programming(!). It's not the type of neuroticism where I want to be at the upper echelons of the tech industry (although that would be neat) and I'm feeling down because I can't make it. It's more like "am I doing this right, am I trying hard enough, am I adequate enough, what is my purpose". 

Question is was I a neurotic person already with programming exacerbating it or did programming make me neurotic. Regardless, here is a list of frequent thoughts I can as a neurotic programming.

## List of Thoughts

- **When learning a new piece of technology:** how much should I read up on before doing the actual thing - am I reading too much - should I be reading this one or that one - *(starts thinking about which resource to read for far too long)* - do I actually know how to apply this stuff, I'm reading it but I'm not doing it - am i just copying the examples, why am I not thinking it through myself first

*list will continue to be updated as I live life*
